# DeepSeaGuard Dashboard - Fully Restored Original Design

## 🎉 Successfully Restored to Original Specifications!

This package contains the DeepSeaGuard dashboard restored to its original established design with all components fully functional and properly integrated.

## ✅ What's Been Restored

### **Original Split-Screen Layout**
- ✅ **Left Side**: Leaflet-based 3D map showing AUV positions and sediment plumes
- ✅ **Right Side**: Dynamic data panels with Environmental, Operational, and Compliance tabs
- ✅ **Dark mode design** with Orbitron/Inter fonts as originally specified

### **Real-Time Environmental Monitoring**
- ✅ **Plume dispersion** visualized as CircleMarkers on the map
- ✅ **Water quality metrics**: Turbidity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen
- ✅ **Protected species proximity alerts**: Benthic Octopod detection within 120m
- ✅ **ISA threshold monitoring**: Sediment levels vs 25 mg/L cap

### **Operational Oversight**
- ✅ **AUV tracking** with real-time coordinates, speed, and heading
- ✅ **Live mission data**: ID, duration, % complete
- ✅ **Battery levels** with visual warnings (critical at <20%, warning at <40%)
- ✅ **Nodules collected** and collection rate efficiency
- ✅ **Interactive AUV selection** on map

### **ISA Compliance Tracking**
- ✅ **Threshold-based evaluations**: Sediment mg/L vs 25 mg/L cap
- ✅ **Time spent in sensitive/restricted zones**
- ✅ **Automated ISA reporting** with modal pop-up to generate reports
- ✅ **Compliance rule tracking**: ISA-ENV-1, ISA-ENV-2, ISA-OPS-1, ISA-REP-1
- ✅ **Export functionality**: JSON and CSV report generation

### **Time-Lapse Playback + Real-Time Alerting**
- ✅ **TimeControls component**: Playback speed (0.5x to 5x) and time zone selection
- ✅ **Alert bell (🔔)** dynamically updates with environmental/operational alerts
- ✅ **Alert system** with severity filtering and timestamps
- ✅ **Live vs Historical** data mode switching

### **Design Aesthetic (Fully Restored)**
- ✅ **Dark mode by default** using --background-dark and --text-light
- ✅ **Fonts**: Orbitron for headings, Inter for body text
- ✅ **Color-coded alerts** by severity (green/yellow/red tones)
- ✅ **Professional ISA compliance interface**

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Extract the files**:
   ```bash
   unzip deepseaguard_restored_complete.zip
   cd deepseaguard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - The dashboard will load with the original split-screen layout

## 📋 Key Features Restored

### **Split-Screen Layout**
- **Left**: Interactive Leaflet map with AUV markers and sediment plumes
- **Right**: Tabbed data panels (Environmental, Operational, Compliance)

### **Interactive Map Features**
- Click AUVs to select and view detailed information
- Sediment plumes color-coded by ISA compliance (red = violation)
- Real-time position tracking with status indicators
- Legend showing AUV status and sediment level thresholds

### **Data Panel Tabs**
1. **Environmental**: Water quality metrics with ISA thresholds
2. **Operational**: Mission progress, battery, efficiency metrics
3. **Compliance**: ISA rule tracking with violation detection

### **Alert System**
- Real-time alerts for proximity warnings, battery levels, compliance violations
- Severity-based filtering (High, Medium, Low)
- Dismissible alerts with timestamps

### **Time Controls**
- Live data vs historical playback
- Playback speed controls for historical data
- UTC time display

### **ISA Reporting**
- Generate compliance reports in JSON/CSV format
- Track specific ISA rules (sediment discharge, sensitive zone time)
- Automated violation detection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Components Structure**
```
src/components/
├── Header.jsx              # Navigation and controls
├── MapView.jsx             # Leaflet map with AUVs and plumes
├── DataPanel.jsx           # Tabbed data container
├── TimeControls.jsx        # Time frame and playback controls
├── AlertSystem.jsx         # Alert management overlay
└── panels/
    ├── EnvironmentalMetrics.jsx
    ├── OperationalData.jsx
    └── ComplianceStatus.jsx
```

### **Key Technologies**
- **React 18.2.0** with functional components and hooks
- **Leaflet** for interactive mapping
- **CSS Variables** for consistent theming
- **Mock data** structured for easy API integration

### **Data Structure**
- **AUVs**: Position, status, battery, mission data
- **Sediment Plumes**: Location, intensity, ISA compliance levels
- **Alerts**: Severity-based environmental and operational warnings
- **Compliance Rules**: ISA standards with current vs threshold values

## 🎯 Ready for Production Integration

The dashboard is now structured exactly as originally specified and ready for:

1. **Backend API Integration**: Replace mock data with real AUV telemetry
2. **Real-time WebSocket**: Connect live data streams
3. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL/InfluxDB for historical data
4. **Authentication**: User management and role-based access
5. **Advanced 3D Visualization**: Upgrade to full Three.js implementation
