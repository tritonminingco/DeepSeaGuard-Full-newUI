## üé¨ **Investor Demo Mode**

Perfect for funding presentations and partnership meetings:

### **Demo Controls Available:**
1. **Trigger Sediment Violation** - Shows real-time violation detection
2. **Enter Sensitive Zone** - Demonstrates geofencing alerts  
3. **Equipment Malfunction** - Simulates emergency response
4. **Start Investor Demo** - Automated presentation sequence

### **Demo Script (5-Minute Pitch):**

**Opening (30 seconds):**
*"Every deep-sea mining operation risks $50M+ in fines for ISA violations. Current monitoring is manual, delayed, and unreliable. We've built the world's first real-time compliance platform."*

**Live Demo (3 minutes):**
1. Show **3 AUVs operating simultaneously** with live telemetry
2. Trigger **sediment violation** - watch real-time alert system
3. Generate **ISA compliance report** - download in 10 seconds
4. Demonstrate **violation prevention** with predictive alerts

**Market Opportunity (1 minute):**
*"200+ ISA mining sites planned globally. $50K/month per site. $120M annual recurring revenue potential. We're not just building software - we're building the regulatory infrastructure for a $30B industry."*

**Closing (30 seconds):**
*"The question isn't whether they'll use our platform - it's whether they'll be allowed to operate without it."*
