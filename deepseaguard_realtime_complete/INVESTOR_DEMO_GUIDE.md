- Show static data: "This demonstrates our data structure"

### **If Demo Scenarios Don't Trigger**:
- Use manual explanation: "In live operations, this would trigger..."
- Show compliance panel: "You can see the thresholds here"
- Focus on report generation: "The key value is instant compliance documentation"

### **If Questions About Technical Details**:
- **Data Sources**: "We support all major AUV manufacturers - Kongsberg, Saab, Bluefin"
